## Description

In this project, we delve into the intricacies of recursion by creating functions that solve specific tasks using this technique. Through these tasks, we get hands-on experience on the possibilities and challenges of using recursion.

## File Descriptions

- `main.h` - This is the header file that contains all the function prototypes used in this project.
- `0-puts_recursion.c` - Contains a function that prints a string followed by a new line.
- (Include descriptions of other files in the directory here...)

## Usage

To compile the files, you can use the following command:
gcc -Wall -pedantic -Werror -Wextra -std=gnu89 _putchar.c main.c FILENAME.c -o OUTPUT

Replace `FILENAME.c` with the C file you wish to compile, and `OUTPUT` with the name you wish to give the compiled output.
