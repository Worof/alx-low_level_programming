# Doubly Linked Lists in C

This repository contains the implementation and exploration of doubly linked lists in C. It's part of the learning projects in data structures, focusing on the concepts and operations related to doubly linked lists.

## Description

Doubly linked lists are a fundamental data structure in computer science, used in various applications due to their flexibility and efficiency in certain operations. This project includes implementations of basic operations such as insertion, deletion, and traversal.

## Usage

To use these functions, compile them with your main C file. For example:

```bash
gcc -Wall -pedantic -Werror -Wextra -std=gnu89 *.c -o [YourProgramName]
