# 0x1E-search_algorithms

This directory contains C programs and related files for implementing and understanding various search algorithms.

## Files

* **0-linear.c**: Contains the implementation of the linear search algorithm.
* **1-binary.c**: Contains the implementation of the binary search algorithm.
* **2-O**: Contains the time complexity (worst case) of a linear search in an array of size n.
* **3-O**: Contains the space complexity (worst case) of an iterative linear search algorithm in an array of size n.
* **4-O**: Contains the time complexity (worst case) of a binary search in an array of size n.
* **5-O**: Contains the space complexity (worst case) of a binary search in an array of size n.
* **6-O**: Contains the space complexity of a given function/algorithm.

## How to Use

1. Compile the C files using `gcc` compiler.
2. Run the compiled executable files to test the search algorithms.
3. View the content of each file to understand the time and space complexities of the algorithms.

## Requirements

* The code is written in C programming language.
* Compiled using `gcc` with flags: `-Wall -Wextra -Werror -pedantic -std=gnu89`.
* All files should end with a new line.
* Usage of `printf` function of the standard library for output.
* Files should use the Betty style.
* No usage of global variables.
* No more than 5 functions per file.
* Prototypes of all functions should be included in the header file `search_algos.h`.
* Header files should be include guarded.
