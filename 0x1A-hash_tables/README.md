# 0x1A-hash_tables

## Project Overview

This project focuses on the implementation and understanding of hash tables in C programming. Hash tables are a key data structure used in computer science for efficient data retrieval. This project involves creating and manipulating hash tables, understanding hashing functions, and dealing with collisions.

## Objectives

- To understand what a hash function is and how to implement one.
- To learn how to handle collisions in hash tables.
- To understand how to use hash tables to create and manage data.
- To gain experience with complex data structures in C.
## Usage

Each file in this directory is a piece of the overall project to implement hash tables. To compile the project, use a command like:

```sh
gcc -Wall -pedantic -Werror -Wextra -std=gnu89 *.c -o hash_tables
