# 0x1C Makefiles

## Overview

This project focuses on the fundamentals of Makefiles in the software build process. Makefiles provide a convenient way to manage the compilation of source code into executable programs. By specifying simple rules, dependencies, and commands in a Makefile, developers can automate the build process, making it more efficient and error-free.
